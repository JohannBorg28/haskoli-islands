Preparation
===========

Discord
-------
`Discord <https://discord.com/>`_ is a communication tool commonly used by the students at the University of Iceland. 
Some courses use Discord to arrange video or chat sessions with teaching assistants to help students with their individual/group assignments.
Communication between student association members also occur often on Discord as it allows different channels for different topics/purposes.


Git
---
`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is an important version control tool used mostly in collaborative work on a software project.
It allows multiple developers to work on different parts of a project at the same time by creating branches.
One or many developers can work on a specific function/feature on a branch.
Several branches can then be merged into one main branch to finish the project.

As a version control system, Git is used to take snapshots of the project as it is developed. 
Developers are responsible to document their progress, i.e. the changes they made to a project. 
Documentation is often overlooked, but its importance really shines through when the project has unintended results/errors down the line.
When a change was commited to the project and later found to have created problems, Git allows developers to revert those changes to the version prior to the commit.

It is common to use Git through the command line interface (CLI).
CLI can be accessed when by opening the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac, Linux) window.


GitHub
------
`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ is one of many locations where developers can save and/or showcase their software projects.
Students often store their group assignments on GitHub as a repository. 
Members of the group can access the project stored in the repository and make changes to it using Git.
